* Figment :: The editor I imagine
  When I say "I", I mean myself - andrewsoutar. This project is, first
  and foremost, an experiment in how to make an editor that would
  improve my productivity and enjoyment. It's also a way for me to
  experiment with writing "proper" GUI apps in Common Lisp.

  There's nothing here right now, and you probably shouldn't be using
  this. But I can't stop you, so here we are. Have fun, I guess.
